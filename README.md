This repo contains a very minimal example of how to issue a credential via your own OCM using javascript.

Please replace `<YOUR OCM IP OR DOMAIN>` and `<YOUR CREDENTIAL DEFINITION ID>` with real values before testing.

Kepp in mind that you will need to create a credential definition and schema to match.

Also, you will need to adjust the credential attributes to conform to you credential definition ID.
